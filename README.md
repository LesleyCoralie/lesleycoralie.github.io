# Nautical Designs
================

Self-Promotional Website
------------------------

For my final assignment in Responsive Web Design 2, I was tasked with building a self-promotional website I designed for my User Experience course that showcases a collection of the work I have made within the Interactive Media design program thus far. 

I have always been attracted to the aesthetic of nautical, sailing imagery, and tattoo art, while finding the mytholgies surrounding sirens and mermaids inticing topics I wanted to explore in my design work. As such, I came up with the website Nautical Designs, a self-promotional site of my work that playfully engages with the theme of sea-faring fantasy.

This website was built using the Bootstrap framework and CSS3. I chose to use Bootstrap while writing my HTML code as I found it was a quick and efficient way to build the infrastructure of my website. Having played around with the framework on previous assignments, I realized that the framework requires less code that manual builds in order to get a website up and running, making it an ideal choice for quick set up.

I found building the skeletal structure for the website with the Bootstrap framework to go relatively quickly, making the process of organizing the page layouts much less time consuming. However, I quickly learned that customizing each of the components and UI elements with CSS styling and overrides to be somewhat of a steep learning curve. At the time of writing, the greatest problem I faced in putting this site together involved setting up the masonry image tiling layout for the portfolio page while getting the images to stay within the dimensions of the container. I solved this issue by doing further research on Bootstrap at getbootstrap.com, and discovered the .img-fluid Bootstrap class which I attributed to my images. As I was spending more time building the infrastructure, I learned more about Bootstrap's classes and styling rules, which in turn meant that I didn't need to input too much custom CSS to style the website.
